# Syntra

Open-source Identity and Access Management. Syntra gives an organization one
place to hold its people, decide what they may reach, and hand them a single
front door to every application they use.

Self-hosted, multi-tenant, Apache-2.0.

## Status

The platform **Core** is built and tested: multi-tenancy, a directory, the
person and contract model, role-based access control, a tamper-evident audit
log, a secrets vault, a job scheduler, notifications, and an administration
console. Access Management and the modules after it are designed but not yet
implemented.

| Module | Status | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| **Core** | built | Multi-tenancy, directory, persons and contracts, RBAC, audit log, secrets vault, scheduler, notifications, web console |
| **Access** | planned | SAML 2.0 IdP, OpenID Connect provider, upstream federation, application catalog, MFA, authentication policies, self-service password reset |
| **Provision** | planned | Source systems, business rules, evaluation and enforcement, target systems, entitlements |
| **Automate** | planned | Product catalog, self-service requests, approval workflows, delegated forms |
| **Govern** | planned | Reconciliation, segregation of duties, recertification campaigns |

Design and plan documents live in [`docs/superpowers/`](docs/superpowers).

## How it is put together

```
apps/
  api/        Fastify: REST API and, later, the SAML and OIDC endpoints
  web/        One React application - portal at /, console at /admin
packages/
  db/         Prisma schema, migrations, the withTenant helper
  core/       Domain services; knows nothing about HTTP
  contracts/  Zod schemas shared by the API and the web app
  ui/         Design system
```

Three decisions shape everything else:

**Tenant isolation is enforced by PostgreSQL, not by application code.** Every
tenant-scoped table has `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` and the application connects
as a non-superuser role without `BYPASSRLS`. A query written without a `where`
clause returns nothing rather than another tenant's rows, and there is a test
that proves it by asking for exactly that.

**A person is not an account.** `Person` is who someone is, `Contract` is what
they do, and `User` is how they sign in. A contractor with two simultaneous
engagements, an employee who moves department mid-year, and a service account
with nobody behind it are all representable.

**Every authentication goes through one function.** `authenticate()` in
`packages/core` is the only path that establishes who a caller is, so policy
and auditing live in one place instead of being reimplemented per protocol.

## Running it

Requires Node 22+, pnpm 9, and Docker.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm db:up                                  # PostgreSQL 16 and MailDev
pnpm db:migrate

cp .env.example .env                        # then fill in the secrets
SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD='choose-a-long-one' \
SEED_USER_PASSWORD='choose-another-one' \
  pnpm seed

pnpm dev                                    # api on :3000, web on :5173
```

Then open **http://acme.localhost:5173** and sign in as `admin`.

The host matters: Syntra picks the tenant from the `Host` header, so
`localhost:5173` will report an unknown tenant while `acme.localhost:5173`
resolves to the seeded tenant.

### Tests

```bash
pnpm test                       # domain, API and database integration tests
pnpm --filter @syntra/web test  # web component tests
pnpm e2e                        # browser tests against a running stack
```

The integration tests run against a real PostgreSQL in Docker. They are not
mocked, because the properties worth testing here — row-level security, a
partial unique index, an append-only rule — only exist in the database.

Two ordering notes for the browser tests. Run `pnpm db:reset && pnpm seed`
*after* `pnpm test`: the integration tests truncate between cases and leave
fixtures behind that fool the seed into thinking the tenant is already
populated. And start the stack with `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` raised, since the
suite signs in far more often in a minute than a person would and the default
limit is right to refuse it.
